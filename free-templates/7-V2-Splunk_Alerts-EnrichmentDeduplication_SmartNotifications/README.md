# Splunk Security Alert Enrichment, Deduplication & Smart Notifications

## Quick overview

This workflow ingests Splunk security alerts via webhook, normalizes and deduplicates them using an n8n Data Table, enriches public source IPs with AbuseIPDB reputation data, calculates a risk score, and sends
severity-based notifications via email and Telegram plus a daily email digest.

## How it works

1.  Receives Splunk alert payloads via a POST webhook and normalizes fields such as severity, source IP, targeted users and hosts, event counts, and timestamps.
2.  Generates a deterministic fingerprint for each alert and looks up the latest matching record in the `Splunk Security Incidents` Data Table to detect duplicates within a 15-minute cooldown window.
3.  If the alert is a duplicate, marks it as suppressed with a zero risk score and stores it in the incidents Data Table without sending notifications. 
4.  If the alert is not a duplicate, checks whether the source IP is a public IPv4 address. Public addresses are enriched with AbuseIPDB reputation data; other addresses continue with default threat-intelligence values.
5.  Computes a composite risk score from Splunk severity, failed attempts, AbuseIPDB confidence score, and targeted user/host counts, then stores the enriched incident record in the Data Table.
6.  Sends Critical/High incidents by email and Telegram, sends Medium incidents by email, and stores Low incidents without notification.
7.  Runs daily at 18:00 to fetch incidents from the previous 24 hours, aggregate security metrics such as severity counts, top source IP/host, suppressed duplicates, and maximum risk score, and send the
    resulting digest by email.

## Setup

1.  Configure Splunk to POST alerts to the Production URL of the `When Splunk Alert Arrives` webhook using the `splunk-security-alert` endpoint.
2.  Run the `When Manually Started` setup path once to create the `Splunk Security Incidents` Data Table and its required schema.
3.  Add your AbuseIPDB API key to the `Key` header in `Fetch AbuseIPDB IP Reputation`.
4.  Configure SMTP credentials on all Email nodes and replace the example sender and recipient addresses with your own.
5.  Configure Telegram Bot credentials and replace `YOUR_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` with the destination chat ID for Critical/High alerts.
6.  Review the default 15-minute deduplication window, risk-scoring thresholds, and the `0 18 * * *` daily digest schedule before activating the workflow.

## Requirements

-   A running n8n instance with Data Tables available.
-   Splunk with an alert configured to send a POST webhook to n8n.
-   An AbuseIPDB API key for public IPv4 reputation enrichment.
-   SMTP credentials and valid sender/recipient addresses for alert and digest emails.
-   A Telegram Bot credential and destination Chat ID if Telegram notifications are required.
-   Network access from n8n to the AbuseIPDB API and to the configured SMTP/Telegram services.

## Customization

-   Adjust the 15-minute deduplication cooldown to match the expected frequency of your Splunk detections.
-   Modify the fingerprint composition if additional fields are needed to distinguish alerts in your environment.
-   Tune risk-score weights and thresholds for Splunk severity, failed attempts, AbuseIPDB confidence, targeted users, and targeted hosts.
-   Change notification routing, for example by sending only Critical incidents to Telegram or adding Slack, Microsoft Teams, ServiceNow, PagerDuty, or another incident-management destination.
-   Extend threat-intelligence enrichment with additional providers while keeping the public/private IP decision branch.
-   Customize email and Telegram message templates, recipients, and the daily digest contents.
-   Change the digest schedule or reporting window to match your operational requirements.

## Additional info

The workflow keeps the original normalized Splunk severity separate from the calculated risk level. This allows an alert reported as `high` by Splunk to be promoted to `critical` when additional context such as
attack volume, target spread, or AbuseIPDB reputation increases its calculated risk.

Duplicate alerts are still stored in the `Splunk Security Incidents` Data Table but do not trigger another notification during the default 15-minute cooldown. This preserves visibility for reporting while reducing alert fatigue.

Threat-intelligence enrichment is only performed for public IPv4 addresses. Private, loopback, link-local, CGNAT, reserved, or unsupported addresses bypass the AbuseIPDB request and continue through
risk scoring with default threat-intelligence values.

The default calculated risk levels are:

    Risk score Level      Default action
------------ ---------- ------------------
       75--100 Critical   Email + Telegram
        50--74 High       Email + Telegram
        30--49 Medium     Email
         0--29 Low        Store only
